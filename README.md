# How to build Frontend Applications without Frameworks?

The basic idea is to write a guide to develop frontend applications with a minimal overhead of libraries and frameworks. That is, instead of using complex frameworks, leverage as much as possible the latest CSS, HTML, and Javascript standards (implemented in the four major browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari), and minimize the number of external dependencies. This is mean to simplify the overall frontend design, optimize long-term maintainability, and potentially improve the performance by reducing the number of software layers used.
